- what is the need of the database?
    - to store triggers and actions at a centralised location
    - would be used in reconstruction of the logstash configuration file
    - Centralised datarepo is required to store the user manual triggers
- sqlite3 
 -  mysql vs sqlite3 
    - mysql is server based whereas sqlite is not
    - smaller (library is in KB whereas 600MB in mysql)
    - easy setup and ease of use for testing
 - issues of sqlite: 
    - user management (multiple user logins)
    - weaker security 
    - less efficient concurrency control 
- why not no-sql
    - Use case for no-sql is diff
        - Fast retrievals allowing redundancy to seep in
        - horizontal scaling to support distributed system executions
        - sharding to improvise the way data is chunked into different       pieces
    - We store parameter vals to generate a logstash conf file not updated frequently [We arent storing sensor data but the threshs]
    - If required, for a given set of system groups, the relations can be sharded

- why not distributed database arch(a basic requirement for no sql db)?
    - would lead to time latencies which would increase the response time to the occuring fault in the system
- Keys in the designed db:
    - Trigger 
        SK& CK & PK = {name,parameter_name}
    - Action 
        SK & CK & PK = {name}
