- Data
    - Collections of raw figurines 
- Information
    - Processed data which gives some sense to the representation of data

- File system vs DBMS
    - redundancy and inconsistency
        - bank DB, lets say savings account has address attr and later a current account is added
          which also has a address attr. Update on either causes an inconsistency
        - both address attrs are stored seperately: wastage of disk space
    - difficult to access data  
        - sql vs request based prgrams for retrieval
        - different formats
    - Data isolation
        - diff formats
    - Integrity probs
        - adding a new constraint for a val, INT,LIMIT,etc is tough
    - Atomicity
        - spl processes / code which has to execute completely without a context switch
    - concurrent- access    
        - resolving multiple client requests
        - locks have to be implemented manually
    - Security
        - rights: admin priviliges and spl user reqs, access permissions can be given

- ABSTRACTION
    - main goal of abstraction is to hide the irrelevant details of a system in the perspective of a given user
    - Each user will get his/her own abstract view of data relevant to his participation in the given domain of the DB
- Achieved through 3 schema architecture
    - What is schema? 
        - A skeleton which provides information about how data is organised in the database
    - 3 schema architecture
        - Physical level
            - Defines parameters of data which define how data is stored
            - Data structure format, Compression formats, Hashing algos used etc
        - Conceptual/logical level
            - What data is stored?
            - Maps the existing domain elements that have to be stored into the db format
            - Has representations of interactions in the real world domain
                - Entities
                - Relationships
                - Constraints
        - View level (also called subschema)
            - Has a defined view schema which contains elements in which that particular user group is intrested in
            - Optimises queries (addition and deletion of data)
            - Secures what parts of data are visible to a given user group
        - Mappings
            - Physical to logical
                - achieves physical data independence
                - any changes in the physical schema dont affect the logical schema
                - the mapping can be updated in case of a change for optimisation / other purposes
            - Logical to view
                - achieves logical data independence
                - changes in this level doesnt affect the views at the view level (unless and until the changes happen to an element that the view contains)
- Instance of a DB  
    - Snapshot of a database at a given instance 
    - Captures the changes of the transactions that are happening to the database
    - The instances can be reversed if the given transactions are reversed to the current instance
- Data models 
    - Deals with how to design the given data at logical level
- Languages
    - DDL: Data Definition Languages
    - DML: Data Manipulation Languages
    - both are provided by sql
    - Query language: A part of DML that serves the CRUD operations from the database and used to define consistency Constraints
- Connectors: JDBC and ODBC
- DBMS App architecture
    - T1 architecture: client,server,DB on the same device
    - T2 architecture: client is connected to the server through a network, db is on the server recieves query directly from client app
    - T3 architecture: app client requests a app server which talks to the db; app server and db are located remotely 


- Relational models
    - Data is represented in tables
    - degree od table: total number of attributes
    - cardinality of table: total number of tuples

- Types of DB? Graph based?

- Keys
    - Super key 
        Any P and C of attr that uniquely identifies a tuple {AB,ABCD,ABE,AC}
    - Candidate key
        Minimum subset from superkey that uniquely identifies a tuple (Attrs arent repreated if they dont add information) {AB,ABE,AC}
    - Primary key
        A chosen value from CK set that has minimum number of attrs {AB/AC}
    - Alternate key
        CK - PK
    - Foreign key
        It is a PK of a relation [Parent table] that is referenced from a child table
        Handles and creates Relationships in between tables
    - Composite key
        PK having multple attrs
    - Compound key 
        PK formed using 2 or more FK
    - Surrogate key*
        integer values added for each tuples when two relations which dont have same/common PK
        can be used as PK
-Integrity Constraints
    - During CRUD ops these constraints should be maintained
    - Domain constraints 
        - Control the types and conditional formats of values that reside in the db {EX: Ph no has to be 10 digits and has to be digits!}
    - Entity constraint 
        - PK cant be NULL
        - Every tuple should be uniquely identifiable 
    - Referntial constraint
        - Insert constraint:
            If the value entered to the ref attr isnt present in the parent table, then the constraint fails
        - Delete constraint 
            A value in the parent table cant be deleted if it has a referncing tuple in the child table. Can be resolved using 3 methods:
                - ON DELETE CASCADE: 
                    deletes all values in the child table that refernece the tuple to bed deleted
                - ON DELETE NULL:
                    replaces the values in the child table with NULL 
                - default: reject the delete request
- Key constraints 
    - NOT NULL : Value cant be NULL 
    - UNIQUE : All the entries in the attr must be unique 
    - DEFAULT : Set a default value for an attribute entry in the relation
    - CHECK : Numerical limits and constraints 
    - PRIMARY KEY
    - FOREIGN KEY
