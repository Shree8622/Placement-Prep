- Encapsulation
    - Data members[states] and member functions[methods] are wrapped in a single entity
    - A class implements Encapsulation
    - Fully encapsulated class  
        - All members are private
    - Adv?
        - Information hiding 
        - we cant access the members of a class outside the class if we dont write getter and setter functions
        - Code reusability
        - Unit testing

- Inheritance
    - A class inherits/ acquires data members and member functions from another class
    - Parent class --> Child class
    - Types:
        - Single 
            A -> B
        - Multi level
            A -> B -> C
        - Hierarchial
            A -> {B,C,D}
        - Multiple
            {A,B} -> C
        - Hybrid inheritance
            Multi-level + Multiple inheritance
    - Ambiguity
        - Multiple inheritance causes this
        - consider {A,B} both have a function named abc()
        - now if class C inherits both A and B,
            it should use scope resolution operator to refer to the function implementation that it is referring to.
        - Solution: virtual class
            - there's no duplication of implementation in a hybrid inheritance
            Ex: A -> {B,C} -> D 
            now B,C have to be declared virtual to make sure D doesnt have multiple implementations of a function in A

- Polymorphism*
    - single object has Multiple forms
    - Types:
        - compiletime
            - function overloading
                - differing by parameter [type and number]
                - default parameters
            - operator overloading [only in cpp]
                - Ex: {+} add and string conatenation
                - Operators that cant be overloaded are  
                    . (dot)  
                    ::(scope resolution) 
                    ?:(ternary)   
                    sizeof() 
        - runtime
            - function overriding

- Abstraction
    - Implementation hiding
    - Showing only required Information
    - Using access modifiers
    - Advantages:
        - Control over who can change what
        - Increases reusability
        - Avoids duplication

    - Interfaces    
        - SAM Interfaces
        - Interfaces dont 'may' contain implementation of the functions
        - Interfaces v/s Abstract classes
            - If no implementation is known, Interfaces
            - If it is partially known, Abstract classes 
    - Abstract classes  
        - cant have objects only refernces
        - contain atleast one abstract method
